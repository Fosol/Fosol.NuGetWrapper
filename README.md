# Fosol.NuGetWrapper 1.0.0.3
Fosol.NuGetWrapper provides a way for any project to automatically build its own NuGet package.

* Please note that updates to Fosol.NuGetWrapper will remove all installed pieces.  This means it will delete your customizations.  Please back them up before updating.

If you have a project that you would like to convert into a NuGet package install Fosol.NuGetWrapper and compile your project.
MSBuild will automatically create a 'Package' folder within your build target folder which will contain your NuGet package.

The default package created for your project will contain all files and folders that are included in your build that are in the following folders; build, content, lib and tools.
In the case of a 'Library' project the package will contain the appropriate assembly ([projectName.dll]).
In the case of an executable project the package will contain the appropriate compiled application.

You may need to manually update the default nuspec configuration file so that other files are included in your package (or excluded).

# Getting Started
It's as simple as installing the Fosol.NuGetWrapper package and building your project.

# Introduction
After installing Fosol.NuGetWrapper you can build your project and it will generate a NuGet package in the targeted output folder.

The process Fosol.NuGetWrapper follows to create your package is as follows;

1. Creates a 'Package' folder in the target output directory.
2. Creates appropriate folders within the 'Package' folder (i.e. build, content, lib and tools).
3. Copy files from target output folder into the 'Package' folder if they have been configured to be included.
4. Generate a nuspec file for the package based on your default "[projectName].nuspec" configuration file.  This uses the XSLT transform feature.
5. Build a NuGet package and place it in the 'Package' folder.

### Package Manager Console Example
1. Open your solution/project in Visual Studio
2. Open the Package Manager Console
3. PM> Install-Package Fosol.NuGetWrapper

### Library Package Manager Tool
1. Open your solution/project in Visual Studio
2. In the "Tools" menu open the "Library Package Manager", then "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution..."
3. Search for "Fosol.NuGetWrapper"
4. Click "Install"

Now build your project and it will create a package in your target output directory (i.e. \bin\debug\Package\)

# Configuration
When you install Fosol.NuGetWrapper it will generated a NuSpec file named after your project, which is in your root project folder ("[projectName].nuspec").
You will need to update the nuspec file before building your project if you want the nuget package to be created.
If you want to include additional assemblies, files and content you may need to follow the NuGet documentation to add those items.  By default Fosol.NuGetWrapper
will include the compiled assembly for the project and all files in the following build output folders; build, content, lib, tools.

If you want to dynamically generate some of the nuspec configuration metadata update the Fosol.NuGetWrapper.props project file.  These values are inserted into the nuspec file used for the package.
Please note that and updates to Fosol.NuGetWrapper will overrwrite your changes to this file.

If you want to add or remove files included in your nuget package you can update the Fosol.NuGetWrapper.props project file.

### PropertyGroup Section

## NuSpec Configuration
Fosol.NuGetWrapper automatically generates a default nuspec configuration file for your project.
It will be given the same name as your project "[projectName].nuspec" and will reside in the root project folder.
This nuspec configuration file is a default template which is used to generate the nuspec file that will be used to create your package.
When updating this file you will need to remember that the file locations will be relative to package output folder (see NuGetOutDir).
Refer to <http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/nuspec-reference> for more information on the nuspec configuration file.
